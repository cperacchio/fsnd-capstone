# Movie Casting App 

This is my final project for the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). It's an app allowing a casting agency to cast actors for upcoming movie projects. 

#### Who's it for?
The Fyyur Casting Agency is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. The agency wants a new system to streamline the casting process, store information about actors and movies, and limit who has access to data based on their role.

#### How does it work?
The app has a page where movie projects are listed and a page where actor profiles are listed. It has pages allowing the agency to create and update both movie projects and actor profiles. And it has a page to match actors with movies in development. Casting an actor for a movie using the app will automatically update the casting details of that movie record. Now, the agency can:
- Easily cast actors for movies using the app
- Keep track of upcoming movie projects, actor profiles, and casting information, all in one place
- Control who can view, create, update, or delete casting information based on their role at the agency

#### How can I access the app?
The casting app has been deployed to Heroku and is currently working at this link:</br> 
<strong>[https://fsnd-capstone-cperacchio.herokuapp.com](https://fsnd-capstone-cperacchio.herokuapp.com/)</strong>

To log in, add /login to the url and enter one set of credentials shown below. To log out, just go to /logout.

## Skills covered
- Coding in Python 3
- Relational database architecture
- Modeling data objects with SQLAlchemy
- Internet protocols and communication
- Developing a Flask API
- Authentication and access
- Authentication with Auth0
- Authentication in Flask
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Testing Flask applications
- Deploying applications

## Dependencies
To access the app locally, you need a database, a virtual environment, dependencies installed, and environment variables set up. You also need an account with Auth0, an authentication service.

1. This app runs on a PostgreSQL database. You can download PostgreSQL at [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. Then head to [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) to create an account.
3. Next, activate a virtual environment:
```
$ cd project_directory_path/
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```
4. Install the dependencies for this project and set up environment variables:
```
$ source setup.sh
```

## Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database locally and connect to it from setup.sh:
```
export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://your_user_name@localhost:XXXX/your_db_name'
```
2. In Auth0, configure a single page web application and its API, relying on the environment variables in setup.sh.
3. Start the development server:  
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py 
$ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode  
$ flask run --reload
```

## Usage

### Casting app roles
Users can access the app's homepage anonymously and its functionality via two roles with specific access permissions.

1. <strong>Casting assistant</strong>: Can view upcoming movie projects and listed actors and see details about both
```
Casting assistant login credentials
User: fyyur.casting.assistant@gmail.com
Password: Auth0123!
```

2. <strong>Executive producer</strong>: Full access, with the ability to view, list, update, and delete both movie projects and actors
```
Executive producer login credentials
User: shanna.rhymes@gmail.com
Password: Auth0123! 
```

### API endpoints
