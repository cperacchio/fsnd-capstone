# Casting App for Capstone Project

This is my final project for the [Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). It's an app allowing you to cast actors to movie projects. It has a page where movies are listed, a page where actors are listed, and a form allowing you to match actors with movies in development.
